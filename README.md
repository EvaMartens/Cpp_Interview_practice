This repository is to keep track of a few of the coding challanges and problems I have solved in order to 
prepare for C++ related Interview. 

Not all of them are from Leet code, some are related to challanges based of my own research of common
Interview questions.

Content:
- fibbonaci numbers
- Erase duplicates from an array (LC mediom)

*LC = Leet Code
