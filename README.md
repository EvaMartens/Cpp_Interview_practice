This repository is to keep track of a few of the coding challanges and problems I have solved in order to 
prepare for C++ related Interviews. 

Not all of them are from Leet code, some are related to challanges based of my own research of common
Interview questions.

Content:
- A main program to run tests
- A test class which allows the user to test code
- fibbonaci numbers
    
Leet code practice problems:
- Erase duplicates from an array (LC medium)
- Best day to buy and sell stock (LC easy)
- Merge two lists (LC easy)
- Reverse array (LC easy)
- remove specific item [using a map implementation] (LC easy)

*LC = Leet Code
